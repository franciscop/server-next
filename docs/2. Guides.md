## Basic usage

Now that you know how to create a barebones server, there are some important bits that you might want to update.

`SECRET`: create an `.env` file (ignored in git with `.gitignore`) with the `SECRET=` and then a long, unique random secret. It will be used to sign and/or encrypt things as needed.

`store`: almost anything you want to persist will need a KV store to do so. For dev you can use an in-memory or a file-based (easy for debugging!) store, but for production systems you would normally use something like Redis. Can be as easy as `const store = new Map();` for dev.

> Note: `bucket` is still _not_ available

`bucket`: if you want to accept user files you will need a place to persist them. By default they are put in the filesystem, but since most cloud providers are ephemeral, provide a `bucket` and it will be used to handle the files directly.

An example of how that works in practice:

```js
// index.js
import server from "@server/next";

import Bucket from "bucket/b2";
import { createClient } from "redis";

const bucket = Bucket("mybucketname", { id, key });
const store = createClient("...").connect();

export default server({ bucket, store })
  .get("/", () => "Hello world")
  .post("/", (ctx) => {
    console.log(ctx.body);
    return 201;
  });
```

## File handling

To manage files, you need to install and use the library [`bucket`](http://bucketjs.com/), which is a very thin wrapper for file management systems. It is also created by the makers of Server.js.

The easiest and default is to set a folder in your filesystem:

```js
import FileSystem from "bucket/fs";

const uploads = FileSystem("./uploads");

// All paths are relative to the CWD
export default server({ uploads })
  .get("/", () => "Hello")
  .put("/users/:id", async (ctx) => {
    // This is the plain string as the file name, already in our FS
    const fileName = ctx.body.profile;
    // 'yOuZEdSsNLq8PgZyLhSz0Llh.jpg'

    // Convert it into a File instance
    const file = ctx.uploads.file(fileName);

    // Now we can use other methods if we want
    // .info(), .read(), .write(), .pipe(), .pipeTo(), etc
    const info = await file.info();
    // {
    //    id: "yOuZEdSsNLq8PgZyLhSz0Llh.jpg",
    //    type: "jpg",
    //    size: 435435,
    //    timestamp: "2024-08-07T14:26:37Z",
    //    // Note: this can be customized providing the option "domain"
    //    url: "file:///Users/me/my-project/uploads/yOuZEdSsNLq8PgZyLhSz0Llh.jpg",
    // }

    return 200;
  });
```

To upload the files to a 3rd party system, you just need to use the corresponding `bucket` implementation (or write a thin compatibility layer). Let's see an example with Backblaze's B2:

```js
import server from "@server/next";
import Backblaze from "bucket/b2";

const uploads = Backblaze("bucket-name", {
  id: process.env.BACKBLAZE_ID,
  key: process.env.BACKBLAZE_KEY,
});

export default server({ uploads })
  .put("/users/:id", async (ctx) => {
    const fileName = ctx.body.profile;
    // 'yOuZEdSsNLq8PgZyLhSz0Llh.jpg'

    // Convert it into a File instance
    const file = ctx.uploads.file(fileName);

    // Now we can use other methods if we want
    const info = await file.info();
    // {
    //    id: "yOuZEdSsNLq8PgZyLhSz0Llh.jpg",
    //    type: "jpg",
    //    size: 435435,
    //    timestamp: "2024-08-07T14:26:37Z",
    //    url: "https://f???.backblazeb2.com/???/yOuZEdSsNLq8PgZyLhSz0Llh.jpg",
    // }

    return 200;
  });
  .;
```

### Example: resizing the user profile picture

Let's see a complete example of uploading and resizing a user profile picture:

```js
import server, { status } from "@server/next";
import sharp from "sharp";
import FileSystem from "bucket/fs";

const uploads = FileSystem("./uploads");

// All paths are relative to the CWD
export default server({ uploads })
  .get("/", () => "Hello")
  .put("/users/:id", async (ctx) => {
    // Create the instance of the file to read and write
    const src = ctx.uploads.file(ctx.body.profile);
    const dst = ctx.uploads.file("/profile/" + ctx.url.params.id + ".jpg");

    const ext = src.id.split(".").pop();
    if (!["jpg", "jpeg", "png", "webp", "avif"].includes(ext)) {
      await src.remove(); // Don't store it
      return status(400).json({ error: "Invalid file format" });
    }

    // Create the Readable, Transform and Writable Node streams
    await pipeline(
      src.readable("node"),
      sharp().resize(200, 200).jpg(),
      dst.writable("node")
    );

    // We no longer need the original file
    await src.remove();

    return status(200).json({ updated: true });
  });
```

Note that the option `uploads` gets converted into a `Bucket` instance and passed as `ctx.uploads`. Th


## JSX

JSX is an amazing template language and so Server.js supports it **when using Bun**. To use it in your project, create a `bunfig.toml` with this content:

```toml
jsx = "react-jsx"
jsxImportSource = "@server/next"
```

Then call your files `.jsx` and you are ready to go!

```jsx
import server from '@server/next';

export default server()
  .get('/', () => <Home />)
  .get('/:page', ctx => <Page id={ctx.url.params.page} />);
```

The main difference to be aware of compared to normal JSX is that you need to include everything, that is the `<html>` tag, `<body>` tag, etc. since we will send whatever is passed as the html. This has more advantages than disadvantages so we thought it was worth it, but there are definitely trade-offs:

- We will send the html fragments unmodified, so `() => <div>Hello</div>` will render `"<div>Hello</div>"`.
- Exception: if you define `<html>...</html>` as the top level, we will automatically inject `<!DOCTYPE html>`, since it's not possible to injext that with JSX.
- You also need to define the top level tags and html structure such as `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>`, etc. We recommend putting those into a template and reusing it, but that's up to your preferences.
- This is [a great match for HTMX](#htmx)!
- You can use fragments as usual with `<></>` (but not with <Fragment>).
- Since you are using JSX, normal interpolation is safe from XSS since any special characters are encoded as their html entities.
- You can set up raw HTML, e.g. to avoid having inline JS scripts escaped, like this: `<script dangerouslySetInnerHTML={{ __html: "alert('hello world');" }}></script>`.

Some examples:

```js
export default server()
  .get('/', () => (
    <html lang="en">
      <head>
        <meta charset="utf-8" />
        <title>My first app</title>
      </head>
      <body>
        <h1>My first app</h1>
        <form>
          Your name:
          <input name="firstname" />
          <br />
          <button>Send</button>
        </form>
        <script src="/handle-form.js"></script>
      </body>
    </html>
  ));
```

## HTMX

While we don't have an explicit HTMX integration, we believe there's two ways of using HTMX with Server.js that are *really* good! First let's see the vanilla version:

```js
export default server()
  .get('/', () => file('index.html'))
  .post('/action', async (ctx) => {
    // do sth

    return '<div>Success!</div>';
  });
```

In here, we assume you have a template in `index.html` and are loading HTMX from there. Then when an action occurs, you can return the raw HTML string.

⚠️ However, if you interpolate strings like that you might be subject to XSS attacks!

```js
.post('/action', async (ctx) => {
  // DO NOT DO THIS
  return `<div>Success! ${ctx.url.query.name}</div>`;
  // DO NOT DO THIS
});
```

For that reason we recommend that you [set up JSX with Server.js](#jsx) and then instead reply like this:

```js
.post('/action', async (ctx) => {
  // This is safe since html entities will be encoded:
  return <div>Success! {ctx.url.query.name}</div>;
});
```

Since JSX will treat that interpolation as a _text_ interpolation and not a _html_ interpolation, html entities will be escaped as expected and presented as plain text.


## JSX

With Server **and Bun**, you can use JSX as a template engine to write your views:

```jsx
// index.jsx
import server from '@server/next';

export default server()
  .get('/', () => (
    <html>
      <body>
        <h1>Hello world</h1>
      </body>
    </html>
  ));
```

> Note that this is **only using JSX** as a template language, not React! So you cannot do events like `onClick`, use hooks like `useEffect()`, etc. Basically, anything that requires you to `import X from 'react';`, you **cannot** use it here!

To do so, first you need to set your project. Create a `bunfig.toml` in the root of your project with this:

```js
jsx = "react-jsx"
jsxImportSource = "@server/next"
```

Then write your `index.jsx` as shown above. Finally, start your project and go to home:

```bash
bun index.tsx
# Open localhost:3000
```

You should see "Hello world" displayed on the screen.
