# About

Hi there, I'm [Francisco](https://francisco.io/). I love Javascript and I am used to help people getting started in Node.js. Normally on the first session witth Express.js there is always a point where I have to say:

> "Please copy this code and paste it here. This will just make your project work as you expect from other languages or systems."

This as you might have guessed is when connecting all the middleware to make POST requests, GZIP, etc work. There's no Django, no Ruby on Rails, no PHP of Node.js.

So I made a modern server that has the defaults well configured and ready to go. You can `npm install server` and it's a fully working local server. Tweak a couple of settings and deploy it to production.

This is ideal to launch quick projects, but Server.js is also very configurable so you can go a long way with it. Please give it a try and let me know what you think!
