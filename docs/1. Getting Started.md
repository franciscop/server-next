# Getting started

First install it:

```
npm install @server/next
yarn add @server/next
bun install @server/next
```

Now you can create your first simple server:

```js
// index.js
import server from "@server/next";

export default server()
  .get("/", () => "Hello world")
  .post("/", (ctx) => {
    console.log(ctx.body);
    return 201;
  });
```

Then run `node .` or `bun .` and open your browser on http://localhost:3000/ to see the message.

There are some major configuration options that you might want to set up though, enumerated in the [Basic Usage](#basic-usage) and explained through the docs.
