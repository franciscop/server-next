# Testing

Testing is an integral part of Server.js, and so we provide some helpers for it! The main one you should usually be aware of is the `.test()` method applied to the app. For the usual test setup, you have your normal server file, and then your test file like this:

```js
// src/index.js - where your server runs
export default server()
  .get('/', () => 'Hello world')
  .get('/obj', () => ({ hello: 'world' }));
```

Then to test that, you can create a test file such as:

```js
// src/index.test.js
import app from './index.js';

// Create a testing endpoint from your app:
const api = app.test();

describe('home', () => {
  it('returns a simple "Hello world"', async () => {
    const { body } = await api.get('/');
    expect(body).toBe('Hello world');
  });

  it('returns a JSON object', async () => {
    const { body, headers } = await api.get('/obj');
    expect(headers['content-type']).toInclude('application/json');
    expect(body).toBe({ hello: 'world' });
  });
});
```

In this example, since it's a normal test file, we showed how to create a testing instance and then calling methods on it. You could also not even create the `api` variable and instead just call it like this:

```js
const { body } = await app.test().get('/');
```

The server is emulating the request/response, but it uses the same logic as Server.js, so tests are blazing fast and follow the proper router/middleware/etc. However, this has the disadvantage that it's not a real HTTP request, so there are some limitations. For example, the compression such as brotli or the content-size header are usually set by the edge proxy, so you won't be able to test those here.
