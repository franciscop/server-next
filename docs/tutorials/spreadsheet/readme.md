# Spreadsheet database

In this tutorial you'll learn how to take a Google Spreadsheet and convert it into a small database for Node.js. We will see some possible applications such as graph statistics and geolocation.

This is useful for simple and small datasets that might be modified by non-technical people since everyone knows how to edit a spreadsheet. The data will then be available on the site as it is modified by several people simultaneously on Google Drive.

Some possible uses:

- Publish a graph with monthly revenue or users info that you are already using internally.
- Startup employee list is in a Spreadsheet for internal use and visible on the website.
- Keep track of your trips similar to [how Martin does it](https://wherethefuckismartin.com/) (note: not related to server.js).



## Create a spreadsheet

First we'll have to go to [Google Spreadsheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/) and create a new Blank spreadsheet:

![Create new spreadsheet in Google Spreadsheets](img/spreadsheet.png)

The spreadsheet has to have a specific structure, where the first row has the names of the columns and the rest has the content:

![Random userlist example](img/userlist.png)

Now we have to publish the spreadsheet so that we can read it from our back-end. Press `File` > `Publish to the web` > `Publish`:

![Publish the spreadsheet to the web](img/publish.png)

Finally make a note of the current spreadsheet URL. It will be something like this: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1FeG6UsUC_BKlJBiy3j_c4uctMcQlnmv9iyfkDjuWXpg/edit



## Installation

After [getting your project started](https://en.libre.university/lesson/V1f6Btf8g/Getting started), we'll be using the packages `server` and [`drive-db`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/drive-db):

```bash
npm install server drive-db
```



## Back-end with server.js

Let's get to the code. Create the entry file `index.js` where the main logic will reside:

```js
// Load the dependencies
const server = require('server');
const { render } = server.reply;

// The URL fragment between "spreadsheets/d/" and "/edit"
const id = '1FeG6UsUC_BKlJBiy3j_c4uctMcQlnmv9iyfkDjuWXpg';
const drive = require('drive-db')(id);

// Launch the server in port 3000
server(async () => {

  // Local or remote (depends on the cache expiration)
  const db = await drive.load();

  // Render the index with the user data
  return render('index.hbs', { users: db.find() });
});
```

Since this is a fairly simple back-end, everything you will need for the back-end is in this file. It loads the libraries, sets up a route and launches the server.



## Front-end

Now let's do some fun stuff with the front-end. Create the file `views/index.hbs` with this basic structure:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <title>Spreadsheet Tutorial</title>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/picnic@6">
  <style>
    main { width: 90%; max-width: 800px; margin: 30px auto; }
    table, canvas, img { width: 100%; }
    h2 { padding-bottom: 20px; }
    .card { margin: 0; }
    #map { height: 400px; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <main>
    <h1>Users</h1>

    ...

  </main>
</body>
```

We added [Picnic CSS](https://picnicss.com/) to make it easier to develop, however you can use any front-end CSS library that you prefer like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) or write your own CSS. We will see several ways of representing our data next.



### Simple list

The easy way, create a list with the first name and last name:

![Simple user list](img/list_simple.png)

To achieve this we are using [Handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/) with some [`{{#each ...}}` looping](http://handlebarsjs.com/builtin_helpers.html#iteration):

```html
<h1>Simple list</h1>
<ul class="flex one three-800">
  {{#each users}}
    <li>{{this.firstname}} {{this.lastname}}</li>
  {{/each}}
</ul>
```

The classes on the `<ul>` come from [Picnic CSS grid system](https://picnicss.com/documentation#grids).



### Table

Let's show them in a table as they appear in the Spreadsheets:

![Table list](img/list_table.png)

If you already know the basics of HTML you'll have guessed this correctly, we are using the native `<table>` element to display it. First we set up the headers and then the content, again looping with an `{{#each ...}}` loop from Handlebars:

```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Firstname</th> <th>Lastname</th> <th>Age</th> <th>City</th>
  </tr>
  {{#each users}}
    <tr>
      <td>{{this.firstname}}</td>
      <td>{{this.lastname}}</td>
      <td>{{this.age}}</td>
      <td>{{this.city}}</td>
    </tr>
  {{/each}}
</table>
```




### Cards

Now let's try showing them as a group of cards such as Airbnb or Dribbble. This is a great way of showcasing creative content:

![Card list](img/list_cards.png)

Our hbs code is a small grid system and some cards, each with its image and footer:

```html
<h2>Cards</h2>

<div class="flex one three-900">
  {{#each users}}
    <div>
      <div class="card">
        <img src="http://lorempixel.com/400/200/?{{this.id}}">
        <footer>{{this.firstname}} {{this.lastname}}, {{this.age}}</footer>
      </div>
    </div>
  {{/each}}
</div>
```

In the real world those images would be stored somewhere, and the `lorempixel` link would still be pointing to the image reference. These card and grid styles come from Picnic CSS.



### Demographics by age

Maybe you have a fairly longer dataset and want to group them by age and display this into a graph like the following:

![Demographics chart](img/demographics_chart.png)

First we will define where we want to include the chart. This will be a small HTML placeholder, since the chart library that we are using works with `<canvas>`:

```html
<h2>Demographics by age:</h2>
<canvas id="people" width="800" height="300"></canvas>
```

For the main logic we will be using javascript. We need to include the library [Chart.js](http://www.chartjs.org/) and inject our users into the Javascript:

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/chart.js/dist/Chart.bundle.min.js"></script>
<script>
  // Create the variable and inject the different parts
  var users = [
    {{#each users}} {
      id: {{{this.id}}},
      firstname: "{{this.firstname}}",
      lastname: "{{this.lastname}}",
      age: {{this.age}},
      city: "{{this.city}}",
    }, {{/each}}
  ];

  // ...
</script>
```

Now that we have the data, in the `...` previously we will write our javascript code to create the chart:

```js
// Get the place where the chart will be drawn
var ctx = document.getElementById("people").getContext('2d');

// Initialize the chart into a variable
var myChart = new Chart(ctx, {
  type: 'bar',
  data: {
    // Group the data by age ranges by filtering those
    labels: ["0-19", "20-39", "40-59", "60+"],
    datasets: [{
      data: [
        users.filter(function(u){ return u.age < 20 }).length,
        users.filter(function(u){ return u.age >= 20 && u.age < 40 }).length,
        users.filter(function(u){ return u.age >= 40 && u.age < 60 }).length,
        users.filter(function(u){ return u.age >= 60 }).length
      ],
      backgroundColor: [
        'rgba(255, 99, 132, 0.5)',
        'rgba(54, 162, 235, 0.5)',
        'rgba(255, 206, 86, 0.5)',
        'rgba(75, 192, 192, 0.5)',
      ]
    }]
  },
  options: {
    legend: { display: false },
    scales: { yAxes: [{ ticks: { beginAtZero: true } }] }
  }
});
```



### Demographics by location

Finally let's geolocate each user into a map:

![Demographics map](img/demographics_map.png)

First we have to create our html placeholder, where the Javascript will position the map. This time it will be a simple div with the id `map`:

```html
<h2>Demographics by location:</h2>
<div id="map"></div>
```

Now we have to create the javascript variable `users`, see the previous point to find out how to do this. Then we create the map and position the markers:

```js
function initMap() {
  var map = new google.maps.Map(document.getElementById('map'), {
    zoom: 4,
    center: { lat: 39, lng: -100 }
  });

  var geocoder = new google.maps.Geocoder();
  users.forEach(function(user) {
    var newAddress;
    geocoder.geocode({ address: user.city + ', United States' }, function(res){
      var marker = new google.maps.Marker({
        position: res[0].geometry.location,
        map: map,
        title: user.firstname
      });
    });
  });
}
```

And finally we have to include Google Maps. You will have to include your own Google Maps API key here where it says `YOUR_API_KEY`:

```html
<script async defer src="https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/js?libraries=places&key=YOUR_API_KEY&callback=initMap"></script>
```

This will call the function `initMap()` when the script is loaded, and effectively create your map with all of the markers.
